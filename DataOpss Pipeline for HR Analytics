## 🔎 Overview

This repository presents the construction of a **DataOps pipeline for data preprocessing, validation, and preparation**, applied to a **Human Resources and psychometric assessment** context.

The project focuses on **data quality, traceability, and reproducibility**, serving as a **trusted foundation** for the full analytical spectrum:

- Descriptive  
- Diagnostic  
- Predictive  
- Prescriptive  

It was intentionally designed as a **strategic DataOps case**, forming the basis for downstream **MLOps workflows**.

> **Key principle:** Without DataOps, there is no MLOps.

## 📌 Business Problem

Organizations frequently face **structural data quality issues** in HR datasets:

| Issue | Business Impact |
|-----|-----------------|
| Missing values | Biased indicators |
| Duplicate records | Distorted aggregates |
| Invalid values (e.g. negative salary) | Incorrect KPIs |
| No schema validation | Silent failures |

These issues **invalidate analyses**, compromise **predictive modeling**, and undermine **causal inference**.

**Core question:**

> *How can raw and inconsistent data be transformed into a reliable, scalable, and production-ready analytical asset?*

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **DataOps pipeline** for data validation and treatment  
- Guarantee **data quality, consistency, and traceability**  
- Prepare datasets for:
  - descriptive and diagnostic analytics
  - predictive modeling
  - causal inference
- Deliver **production-ready data artifacts**

---

## 🔍 Methodological Approach

The project explicitly covers the **end-to-end analytical lifecycle**.

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution inspection
- Outlier and inconsistency detection
- Impact analysis on business indicators

### 2️⃣ Data Quality Validation (DataOps)
Explicit **data quality gates**:

- Salary ≥ 0  
- Age within plausible range  
- No duplicate records  
- Controlled missing rate  
- Schema and data type validation  

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Treatment
- Correction or removal of invalid values  
- Deduplication  
- Context-aware imputation strategies  

### 4️⃣ Feature Readiness
- Final dataset structured and versioned  
- Features ready for modeling  
- Suitable foundation for predictive and causal analyses

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

### Data & Analysis
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

### Data Engineering / DataOps
- Modular pipeline (`src/`)  
- Raw vs processed data separation  
- Artifact versioning  
- Explicit validation rules  

### MLOps Foundation
- Reproducible pipeline  
- Model-ready data artifacts  
- Compatible with:
  - MLflow  
  - Feature Stores  
  - CI/CD pipelines

## 🧠 Technical Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|
| Modular pipeline | Scalability, testing, automation |
| Explicit quality rules | Prevent silent production failures |
| Raw/processed separation | Core DataOps principle |
| Data versioning | Reproducibility and auditability |
| Notebook + code | Balance exploration and engineering |

These choices reflect a **production-first mindset**, not exploratory analysis only.

## 📦 Final Deliverables

- `data/processed/dataset_clean_v1.csv`  
  - validated, production-ready dataset  
- Reproducible preprocessing pipeline  
- Analytical report with:
  - identified issues
  - decisions taken
  - impact of corrections  

---

## 📊 Actionable Insights

- HR data without validation leads to **biased decision-making**
- Invalid values significantly distort aggregates
- **Data quality is a prerequisite** for:
  - reliable predictive models
  - valid causal inference
  - strategic decision-making  

> **Insight:** DataOps enables MLOps. Not the other way around.

## 🚀 Delivery & Deployment Readiness

Although executed locally, the project was structured as **production-ready**.

### Data Zones

```text
data/raw        → raw input data
data/processed  → validated and versioned datasets
src/            → reusable pipeline logic
artifacts/      → model-ready assets
